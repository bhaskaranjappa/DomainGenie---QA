The "LLM Fine-tuning for Domain-Specific Q&A" project focused on enhancing the relevance and accuracy of large language models when answering questions within a specific domain. The core strategy involved fine-tuning a cutting-edge GPT model on a carefully curated, specialized dataset relevant to the target subject, which led to a 15% improvement in answer relevance compared to the modelâ€™s baseline. To further optimize efficiency and reduce computational expenses, the project utilized parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques such as LoRA, enabling effective adaptation without retraining the entire model. Comprehensive model evaluation was conducted using domain-specific metrics to ensure that the fine-tuned system delivered precise, context-aware responses. All experiment tracking and result analysis were systematically managed with MLflow, providing visibility and reproducibility across development cycles. This approach resulted in a scalable, high-performing Q&A solution tailored for complex, niche domains, making it particularly suitable for integration into enterprise systems seeking advanced, context-sensitive information retrieval capabilities.
